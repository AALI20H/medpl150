  <h2>Reflection </h2>

  <p>

    My 4 photos I decided to pick were honestly boring to me, these images were lacking and I struggled adjusting my aperture. In photographs 1&2  I tried to photograph a manga I was carrying at the time. It may be because it had a white background but I really struggled taking the shallow DoF photo, the background just wouldn't blur, what happened was the opposite, the book cover blurred instead of the background. On the other hand, the Deep DoF image turned out much better. Personally, it was much easier to do a deep DoF than a shallow DoF. I learned that the lower the aperture the more isolated the subject becomes, the subject becomes sharper while the background gets blurred. For example, F/3 would blur the background while sharpening the subject. Following the same concept, the higher the aperture the more is seen in that image. Higher aperture keeps the entire scene in focus unlike lower aperture. F20 would be considered high and it'd capture everything, In photoshop, creating the blur was much more simple for me, I first uploaded the image then selected the object selection tool. After that, with the tool I clicked and dragged on the water bottle until it properly highlighted pink. Once it was properly highlighted I inverted the selection so that now the background is highlighted. Once that was done, I opened the filter on the menu then selected field blur. I adjusted the blur to my liking then I exported.
