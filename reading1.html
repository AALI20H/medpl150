	<p>Susan Sontag believed that photography is a very powerful tool that is used to document reality. She believed that rather than just simply recording the world through photography, it's able to shape experiences and it is able to alter the way we understand the world. Sontag argues that photos do a bad job in representing the world due to all the factors that play a role. Because of this Sotang compares photography to platos cave, platos  cave is an allegory that represents how people mistake what they see as reality, while true understanding comes from actually experiencing the moment. She goes on to convey that the same concept applies to current day and age. For example, social media, social media enables people to take photos of their lives and post it online for others to see. This is significant because people usually tend to only show the best versions of themselves or try to create a false narrative of themselves. The majority of social media posts are made with the idea of appealing to an audience instead of living in those moments. Due to being so focused on taking photos of your life can distance you from the actual moment and the experience. Sontag says, “Today everything exists to end in a photograph” (page 6) Rather than being in the experience we put more effort into taking a photo and making sure we look presentable. </p>
<p>To me, to capture images and create graphics is to allow others to look at a different lens, my lens. When I go and take a photo I am planning to take it in a way that allows others to see things from my perspective. I hope to help others visualize other points of view that they may have not realised existed. The images I take and the images I create serve more purpose than just capturing what is or isn't there, I am choosing what is seen and how it is seen. In addition, Sotang describes photography as turning an experience into a way of seeing. She says, “But other, less liberating feelings are expressed as well. It would not be wrong to speak of people having a compulsion to photograph: to turn experience itself into a way of seeing.”( page 6) The quote shows how images and photos are able to hold influential powers over people. By changing things such as the angle of a photo we are able to mold what the viewer is thinking. This connects to my previous paragraph because the things I do also alter reality, I can control what my viewers are and aren't seeing which can hinder their understanding. This article by Susan Sontag has helped me reflect on how photography can be something that shows us a moment but it being different in actuality. This contrasts how we live, we are constantly being surrounded by images and photos but we aren't actually connected at a deeper level. Ultimately, images can reveal both truths and distort understanding.</p>
