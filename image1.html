  <img src="image1.jpg" alt="Exit" width="300">

  <p> I chose this image because the idea is simple, its an exit sign. Even though its jsut a sign I tried to use empphasis in order to draw the viewers attention to the big bold letters. Addtionally while editing the image on the adjustment layer I realised that I stregthen the red in order to create strong contrast of color and value. </p>
