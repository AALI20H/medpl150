	<p>     The article “With ‘AI slop’ distorting our reality, the world is sleepwalking into disaster” by Nesrine Malik goes over an interesting topic of AI and how its being used to create low quality mass produced content, she refers to it as “AI slop”. Malik claims that this type of content is dangerous not simply because of the misinformation pushed but because the way the content uses real humans and mixes them with fake experiences. SHe claims that this mix creates a false reality in your mind and it could eventually lead to altered thoughts. She states, “You are immersed deeper and deeper into subjective worlds rather than objective reality.” As people continuously scroll through AI content reality becomes harder and harder to recognize. The two become nearly indistinguishable and overtime damage is dealt. This can also relate to politics. Malik points out that AI slop can be used very politically, creating and pushing biases. AI slop is content that anyone can create meaning that anyone can push any agenda and ideologies. She says, “White supremacy, autocracy, and fetishisation of natural hierarchies in race and gender are packaged as nostalgia for an imagined past. AI is already being described as the new aesthetic of fascism.” AI slop is unfortunately accessible and easy to create and people take advantage of it. To add on, these agendas are easily pushed as well because  social media companies encourage the countless of uploads posted. These companies benefit off the engagement meaning that they don't care about the quality which is why AI slop thrives.  </p>
<p>     Personally, I couldn't agree more with Nesrine Malik, all the points she makes in the articles I completely agree with. As someone who uses social media everyday I have first hand experience of “AI slop”. Everytime I encounter slop  I always feel so uneasy and usually skip past it. Seeing a real life human being doing  something artificially made is so uncanny. It's not only the content that's so disturbing  but also how easy it is to create and spread. Everytime I watch these types of videos just like Malik I understand how it creates a false reality. The more I see it the harder it becomes to believe what I'm looking at. And with the rapid upgrades and improvements of AI tools this further continues to be an issue. Which is why I also believe that AI generative tools shouldn't be as accessible as it is right now. Some ideologies can be destructive and even harmful and social media algorithms would circulate it around which is why the more we are exposed to content like this we can possibly get affected. Overall, this article helped me reflect how easy AI and technology can alter and influence people's thoughts. Malik compares this influence to “sleepwaking into disaster" because we are blindlessly consuming this content and it's slowly reshaping our perception of reality without us noticing. This is why I believe that AI content, especially AI slop, is very destructive for us..</p>
