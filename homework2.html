  <h2>Reflection</h2>
 
<p> I found this assignment very informative and interactive. For starters, photography, we needed to take 5 photos of things that caught our eyes across the building. Being able to get up and take photos was a great start for me because I haven't touched an actual camera in a couple years. The camera we used was foreign to me so being able to actually use it instead of just looking at photos of it was a great way to learn and get used to it. For the second half of the assignment on photoshop I was able to learn how to resize images and properly crop them while adjusting colors. This part of the assignment was also very enjoyable, I’ve never actually used photoshop but I've used apps like it so I was somewhat comfortable using it. Out of everything we’ve done using photoshop I think I enjoy playing around and experimenting with the adjustment layer. Aside from learning the basics I think I spent most of my time messing around with adjusting the shadows, midtones, and highlights. Overall my experience with photography and photoshop in this class has been a pleasant one. I understand I still have a lot to learn with both photography and photoshop however I am willing to put in the effort in order to succeed. I believe by combining both of these tools, I will be able to move past just “capturing reality" and I’ll be able to convey a meaningful message into my work. </p>
