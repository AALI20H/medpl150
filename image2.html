  <img src="image2.jpg" alt="Lockers" width="300">

  <p> I chose this image because I liked the captured unity between all the lockers, each one lined up in rows. I tried to create an organized composition where the lockers are lined up and are sat neatly. I couldve done a better job with the original photoshop however, in my adjustment layer I cropped out some of the photo while also lighting up the photo. </p>
